# To do

This TODO file lists ideas and features for future developments.

Unless written, no activity has been started on the topics.

## Smaller things

Remove GuardIntervalInserter implementation for window==0, as it was shown both are equivalent.

## Resampler improvements

- Assess quality of window currently used.
- Evaluate usefulness of other windows.
- Distribute energy of Fs bin equally to both negative and positive frequencies in the back buffer.

## Review CicEq

The CIC Equaliser was used for the USRP1 to compensate for spectrum flatness.
It is not documented, and its effect poorly explained. Review if still needed,
and document appropriately.
