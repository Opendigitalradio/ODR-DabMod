General:
======================
	The CMake build of the odr-dabmod provides an alternative to the auto make tools build system (described in INSTALL) and provides:
	* Static linking of boost and zeromq, avoiding version conflicts in case the system contains other version of these libraries
	* Enables cross platform builds

Required dependencies:
======================
	See INSTALL.

Prerequisites
======================
	CMake
	=====
	Make sure CMake is installed in your system.

	Boost
	=====
	Boost is statically linked into the odr-dabmod, and because of that it needs a little special attention.

	Download desired version of boost from www.boost.org and extract to any directory, e.g. /home/user/thirdpart/boost/

	A one-time build of the tool b2/bjam is also needed. Run bootstrap within the BOOST_ROOT-folder.

	Configure the BOOST_ROOT environment variable to point to the root folder of the Boost file tree.

	E.g. Linux
	Add the variable in the ~/.bash_profile file.

	TEMPLATE_BOOST_ROOT="/home/user/thirdpart/boost/boost_1_59_0"
	export TEMPLATE_BOOST_ROOT

	ZeroMQ
	=====
	ZeroMQ is statically linked into the odr-dabmod, and because of that it needs a little special attention.
	Download desired version of ZeroMQ from https://github.com/zeromq (either by git clone or download the zip file).
	It's recommended that the stable release branch is used e.g. https://github.com/zeromq/zeromq4-x.

	NOTE: The archive files from http://download.zeromq.org/ cannot be used as they do not contain CMake build projects.

	We also need to configure the ZMQ_ROOT environment variable to point to the root folder of the ZeroMQ file tree.

	E.g. Linux
	Add the variable in the ~/.bash_profile file.

	ZMQ_ROOT="/home/user/thirdpart/zeromq4-x
	export ZMQ_ROOT

Build procedure:
=========================
	Download the odr-dabmod (see INSTALL)
	Within the odr-dabmod root directory do:
	$ mkdir build && cd build
	$ cmake ..
	$ make
	$ make install

Configure options
=================
	Some options can be given to cmake command:
	# common options
	Provide an install directory: -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/my/install/dir
	Release or debug builds: -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release|Debug

	# odr-dabmod options
	Use FFTW3 library (default=off, kiss_fft is used by default): -DFFTW3=on
	Support UHD output (defailt=on): -DUHD=off
