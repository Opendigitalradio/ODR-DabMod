[modulator]
;   Mode 'fix' uses a fixed factor and is really not recommended. It is more
; useful on an academic perspective for people trying to understand the DAB
; modulation.
;
;   Mode 'max' is the normalization of every OFDM symbol. No overshoot, no
; truncating, but varying output power (around 3dB) which might not be the best
; for some power amplifier. The output samples are limited to a magnitude
; of 32768.
;
;   Mode 'var' uses the method specified in ETSI 300 798 Clause 5.3. This method
; normalizes to 4 times the standard deviation for an approximation of the RMS
; power. So around 6/100000 samples will be truncated and will introduce some
; really minor distortion. But this mode also maximizes the output power. This
; is the gain mode recommended for real world operation as it is based on a DAB
; standard; the only difference is that ODR-DabMod internally calculates this with
; 32-bit floats instead of 8 bits.
gainmode=var
;
;   In mode var, you can choose to normalise the samples to something else than
; 4 times the standard deviation.
;normalise_variance=4

; Transmission mode
; If not defined, use Transmission Mode 1
;mode=1

; The digital gain is a value that is multiplied to each sample. It is used
; to tune the chain to make sure that no non-linearities appear up to the
; USRP daughterboard programmable gain amplifier (PGA).
; If there is clipping, the spectral quality of the signal will quickly deteriorate,
; and wide-band noise will be generated.
;
; Be aware that there is a dependency with resampling.
digital_gain=0.8

; Output sample rate. Values other than 2048000 enable
; resampling.
; Warning! digital_gain settings are different if resampling
; is enabled or not !
rate=2048000

; (DEPRECATED) CIC equaliser for USRP1 and USRP2
; These USRPs have an upsampler in FPGA that does not have a flat frequency
; response. The CIC equaliser compensates this. This setting is specific to
; the USRP1 and USRP2 devices.
; Set to 0 to disable CicEqualiser
;dac_clk_rate=0

; The USRP1 does not have flexible clocking, you will need
;rate=3200000
; and
;dac_clk_rate=128000000

; When nonzero, overlap ofdmwindowing samples from each OFDM symbol
; onto the previous and next symbol, using a raised cosine window function.
; This has the effect of smoothing the transition from one symbol to the next,
; which improves spectrum shape.
; In Transmission Mode I, every data symbol is composed of 2552 samples.
;ofdmwindowing=10

; Settings for crest factor reduction. Statistics for ratio of
; samples that were clipped are available through the RC.

[output]
; choose output: possible values: uhd, file, zmq, soapysdr, limesdr
output=uhd

[fileoutput]
; Two output formats are supported: In the default mode,
; the file output writes I/Q float values (i.e. complex
; float) to the file. The I and Q samples can take values up
; to 810000 in absolute magnitude with gainmode FIX. With
; gainmode VAR and FIX, they should never exceed 50000.
;format=complexf
;
; The complexf_normalised format applies a compensation factor to the complexf
; output to bring the range of the I and Q components to [-1.0 .. 1.0]. The
; digital_gain is still applied on top of that normalisation.
;format=complexf_normalised
;
; When the format is set to s8, the output writes I/Q 8-bit
; signed integers, where the magnitude is multiplied by 128/50000
; effectively mapping the gainmode VAR range of -50000 -- 50000
; to -128 -- 128. For other gainmodes, use the digital_gain setting
; to make sure you don't create clipping.
;
; The format u8 is the same as s8, except that the values are mapped
; between 0 and 255. Use u8 for welle.io, qt-dab or other tools.
;
; Also supported is s16, with system endianness (little endian on x86_64 and ARM)
;format=s8

; The output file:
filename=ofdm.iq

show_metadata=0

[uhdoutput]
; The UHD output can be directly used with the Ettus USRP devices
;
; You have to set master_clock_rate to a multiple of the
; sample_rate. Ideally, it should be
;   master_clock_rate = 4 * sample_rate
; or even a higher factor.
;
; Settings for the B200:
device=
master_clock_rate=32768000
type=b200
txgain=40
; The B200 needs larger gains (up to 89dB) but,
; "Gain settings are application specific, but it is recommended that users
; consider using at least half of the available gain to get reasonable dynamic
; range."
;    From the B200 User Manual
;    http://files.ettus.com/uhd_docs/manual/html/usrp_b200.html

; Override automatic analog frontend bandwidth calculation. Units: Hz
;bandwidth=2000000

; Some USRP boards/frontends support setting an LO offset that has the
; effect of shifting DC out of the signal bandwidth. This should also
; improve IQ imbalance effects, because the mirror will centered on another
; frequency (it should be on frequency + 2*lo_offset)
;
; The value can be negative, and its absolute value must be smaller than
; master_clock_rate/2.
